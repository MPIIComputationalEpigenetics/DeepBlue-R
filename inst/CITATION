         abstract ="Large amounts of epigenomic data are generated under 
         the umbrella of the International Human Epigenome Consortium, 
         which aims to establish 1000 reference epigenomes within the next 
         few years. These data have the potential to unravel the complexity of 
         epigenomic regulation. However, their effective use is hindered by the 
         lack of flexible and easy-to-use methods for data retrieval. 
         Extracting region sets of interest is a cumbersome task that involves 
         several manual steps: identifying the relevant experiments, 
         downloading the corresponding data files and filtering the region 
         sets of interest. Here we present the DeepBlue Epigenomic Data Server, 
         which streamlines epigenomic data analysis as well as software 
         development. DeepBlue provides a comprehensive programmatic interface 
         for finding, selecting, filtering, summarizing and downloading 
         region sets. It contains data from four major epigenome projects, 
         namely ENCODE, ROADMAP, BLUEPRINT and DEEP. DeepBlue comes with a 
         user manual, examples and a well-documented application 
         programming interface (API). The latter is accessed via the 
         XML-RPC protocol supported by many programming languages. 
         To demonstrate usage of the API and to enable convenient data 
         retrieval for non-programmers, we offer an optional web interface.
